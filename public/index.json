As the tipping point is approached, the dynamics of complex and varied systems simplify down to a limited number of possible “normal forms” that determine qualitative aspects of the new state that lies beyond the tipping point, such as whether it will oscillate or be stable. In several of those forms, indicators like increasing lag-1 autocorrelation and variance provide generic early warning signals (EWS) of the tipping point by detecting how dynamics slow down near the transition. But they do not predict the nature of the new state. Here we develop a deep learning algorithm that provides EWS in systems it was not explicitly trained on, by exploiting information about normal forms and scaling behavior of dynamics near tipping points that are common to many dynamical systems. The algorithm provides EWS in 268 empirical and model time series from ecology, thermoacoustics, climatology, and epidemiology with much greater sensitivity and specificity than generic EWS. It can also predict the normal form that characterizes the oncoming tipping point, thus providing qualitative information on certain aspects of the new state. Such approaches can help humans better prepare for, or avoid, undesirable state transitions. The algorithm also illustrates how a universe of possible models can be mined to recognize naturally occurring tipping points.","tags":["deep learning","bifurcation","tipping point","time series"],"title":"Deep learning for early warning signals of tipping points","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas M Bury","Claudia Lerma","Gil Bub","Zachary Laksman","Marc W Deyell","Leon Glass"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1601510400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653321816,"objectID":"aead9490ca70f245ffc80741d0559250","permalink":"https://thomasbury.net/publication/bury_chaos_20/","publishdate":"2022-05-23T16:03:36.593382Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bury_chaos_20/","section":"publication","summary":"We have analyzed the electrocardiographic data collected during continuous 7-day ambulatory recordings in patients with frequent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs). We analyze the dependence of the frequency and patterns of PVCs on the heart rate and the time of the day. Patients display rhythms of a complex yet consistent structure. In a given patient, the pattern remains robust over different days and particular repetitive patterns appear at specific heart rates, suggesting the appearance of bifurcations in the dynamics. Over the course of 24 h, we find that in some patients, patterns appear to depend only on the heart rate, whereas in others, both the time of the day and the heart rate play a role in controlling the dynamics. Identifying parameter values at which bifurcations occur facilitates the development of dynamical models for arrhythmia. The use of powerful recording and analysis techniques will enable improved analysis of data and better understanding of mechanisms of arrhythmia in individual patients.","tags":[],"title":"Long ECGs reveal rich and robust dynamical regimes in patients with frequent ectopy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas M Bury","Chris T Bauch","Madhur Anand"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653321816,"objectID":"388767ef5122fa74346585e040312748","permalink":"https://thomasbury.net/publication/bury_interface_20/","publishdate":"2022-05-23T16:03:36.741744Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bury_interface_20/","section":"publication","summary":"Theory and observation tell us that many complex systems exhibit tipping points—thresholds involving an abrupt and irreversible transition to a contrasting dynamical regime. Such events are commonly referred to as critical transitions. Current research seeks to develop early warning signals (EWS) of critical transitions that could help prevent undesirable events such as ecosystem collapse. However, conventional EWS do not indicate the type of transition, since they are based on the generic phenomena of critical slowing down. For instance, they may fail to distinguish the onset of oscillations (e.g. Hopf bifurcation) from a transition to a distant attractor (e.g. Fold bifurcation). Moreover, conventional EWS are less reliable in systems with density-dependent noise. Other EWS based on the power spectrum (spectral EWS) have been proposed, but they rely upon spectral reddening, which does not occur prior to critical transitions with an oscillatory component. Here, we use Ornstein–Uhlenbeck theory to derive analytic approximations for EWS prior to each type of local bifurcation, thereby creating new spectral EWS that provide greater sensitivity to transition proximity; higher robustness to density-dependent noise and bifurcation type; and clues to the type of approaching transition. We demonstrate the advantage of applying these spectral EWS in concert with conventional EWS using a population model, and show that they provide a characteristic signal prior to two different Hopf bifurcations in data from a predator–prey chemostat experiment. The ability to better infer and differentiate the nature of upcoming transitions in complex systems will help humanity manage critical transitions in the Anthropocene Era.","tags":[],"title":"Detecting and distinguishing tipping points using spectral early warning signals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas M Bury","Chris T Bauch","Madhur Anand"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653321817,"objectID":"c5cedcc8c17d94299f32d4cb58f72d59","permalink":"https://thomasbury.net/publication/bury_plos_19/","publishdate":"2022-05-23T16:03:37.066679Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bury_plos_19/","section":"publication","summary":"Geophysical models of climate change are becoming increasingly sophisticated, yet less effort is devoted to modelling the human systems causing climate change and how the two systems are coupled. Here, we develop a simple socio-climate model by coupling an Earth system model to a social dynamics model. We treat social processes endogenously—emerging from rules governing how individuals learn socially and how social norms develop—as well as being influenced by climate change and mitigation costs. Our goal is to gain qualitative insights into scenarios of potential socio-climate dynamics and to illustrate how such models can generate new research questions. We find that the social learning rate is strongly influential, to the point that variation of its value within empirically plausible ranges changes the peak global temperature anomaly by more than 1°C. Conversely, social norms reinforce majority behaviour and therefore may not provide help when we most need it because they suppress the early spread of mitigative behaviour. Finally, exploring the model’s parameter space for mitigation cost and social learning suggests optimal intervention pathways for climate change mitigation. We find that prioritising an increase in social learning as a first step, followed by a reduction in mitigation costs provides the most efficient route to a reduced peak temperature anomaly. We conclude that socio-climate models should be included in the ensemble of models used to project climate change.","tags":[],"title":"Charting pathways to climate change mitigation in a coupled socio-climate model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A Demetri Pananos","Thomas M Bury","Clara Wang","Justin Schonfeld","Sharada P Mohanty","Brendan Nyhan","Marcel Salathé","Chris T Bauch"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653321817,"objectID":"29b9b4a76bb6f94eb391f4bb030b1b63","permalink":"https://thomasbury.net/publication/pananos_pnas_17/","publishdate":"2022-05-23T16:03:36.916915Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pananos_pnas_17/","section":"publication","summary":"Complex adaptive systems exhibit characteristic dynamics near tipping points such as critical slowing down (declining resilience to perturbations). We studied Twitter and Google search data about measles from California and the United States before and after the 2014–2015 Disneyland, California measles outbreak. We find critical slowing down starting a few years before the outbreak. However, population response to the outbreak causes resilience to increase afterward. A mathematical model of measles transmission and population vaccine sentiment predicts the same patterns. Crucially, critical slowing down begins long before a system actually reaches a tipping point. Thus, it may be possible to develop analytical tools to detect populations at heightened risk of a future episode of widespread vaccine refusal.","tags":[],"title":"Critical dynamics in population vaccinating behavior","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"title: Teaching summary: Here we describe how to add a page to your site. date: “2018-06-28T00:00:00Z”\nreading_time: false # Show estimated reading time? share: false # Show social sharing links? profile: false # Show author profile? comments: false # Show comments?\nheader: caption: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\nimage: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\nAdd your content here…\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"322dbaccf72a6d71f827fdb2866be935","permalink":"https://thomasbury.net/teaching/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/","section":"","summary":"title: Teaching summary: Here we describe how to add a page to your site. date: “2018-06-28T00:00:00Z”\nreading_time: false # Show estimated reading time? share: false # Show social sharing links? profile: false # Show author profile?","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page"}]
