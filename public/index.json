Deep learning classifiers can provide an early warning signal for critical transitions by learning generic features of bifurcations from large simulated training data sets. So far, classifiers have only been trained to predict continuous-time bifurcations, ignoring rich dynamics unique to discrete-time bifurcations. Here, we train a deep learning classifier to provide an early warning signal for the five local discrete-time bifurcations of codimension-one. We test the classifier on simulation data from discrete-time models used in physiology, economics and ecology, as well as experimental data of spontaneously beating chick-heart aggregates that undergo a period-doubling bifurcation. The classifier shows higher sensitivity and specificity than commonly used early warning signals under a wide range of noise intensities and rates of approach to the bifurcation. It also predicts the correct bifurcation in most cases, with particularly high accuracy for the period-doubling, Neimark-Sacker and fold bifurcations. Deep learning as a tool for bifurcation prediction is still in its nascence and has the potential to transform the way we monitor systems for critical transitions.","tags":["deep learning","bifurcation","tipping point","time series","cardiac arrhythmia"],"title":"Predicting discrete-time bifurcations with deep learning","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Khady Diagne","Thomas M Bury","Marc W.

They correspond to phenomena such as the onset of an epidemic, a cardiac arrhythmia, and the collapse of an ecosystem.\nWhen a system is near to a bifurcation, there are universal properties of bifurcations that can emerge when sufficient data is collected. One example is critical slowing down (shown above), where the recovery rate decreases close to the bifurcation.\nI am interested in the development of computational tools based on the theory of dynamical systems and machine learning to help predict the onset of a bifurcation in various natural systems.\nRelevant work:\nSadria, M., \u0026amp; Bury, T.

A healthy heartbeat is the result of electrical propagation that travels through the heart, resulting in contraction of the cardiac tissue and pumping of blood to the body. A cardiac arrhythmia occurs when this propagation is disrupted in some way. Wearable device technology has reached the point where we can monitor the electrical activity of our hearts for extended periods of time, amassing a wealth of data. I am interested in using mathematical models and machine learning to better understand and predict the dynamics of the hearts in patients who have cardiac arrhythmia. This work is in collaboration with cardiologists at the University of British Columbia and Weill Cornell Medicine and experimental physiologists at McGill University.\nRelevant work:\nBury, T.

They can be at rest, propagate planar waves following a stimulus (left), propagate self-sustaining spiral waves (right), or show more complicated spatio-temporal behaviour. Spiral waves in the human heart are responsible for ventricular tachycardia—a dangerous cardiac arrhythmia. I am interested in how excitable systems can transition into spiral wave dynamics. To study this, I am combining mathematical models with reinforcement learning—a branch of machine learning designed to discover sequential actions that achieve a pre-defined task.\nThis work is in collaboration with physiologists in the Bub lab, who are conducting experiments with spiral waves in real cardiac tissue. Videos show motion transients from thin sheets of mouse cardiac tissue.\nMechanistic modelling of biological systems Mathematical models can be built for a biological system based on mechanistic principles. We can then analyse the dynamics of the model (e.g. equilibria, stability, orbits) to gain insights into the biology. I am broadly interested in the application of models to systems in ecology, epidemiology, physiology and Earth System science. A particular aspect I have studied is how human group behaviour interplays with these systems. For example, I extended a simple Earth system model to include dynamics of human behaviour to study how factors such as social norms and rates of social learning affect climate change trajectories.\nRelevant work:\nBury, T.

As the tipping point is approached, the dynamics of complex and varied systems simplify down to a limited number of possible “normal forms” that determine qualitative aspects of the new state that lies beyond the tipping point, such as whether it will oscillate or be stable. In several of those forms, indicators like increasing lag-1 autocorrelation and variance provide generic early warning signals (EWS) of the tipping point by detecting how dynamics slow down near the transition. But they do not predict the nature of the new state. Here we develop a deep learning algorithm that provides EWS in systems it was not explicitly trained on, by exploiting information about normal forms and scaling behavior of dynamics near tipping points that are common to many dynamical systems. The algorithm provides EWS in 268 empirical and model time series from ecology, thermoacoustics, climatology, and epidemiology with much greater sensitivity and specificity than generic EWS. It can also predict the normal form that characterizes the oncoming tipping point, thus providing qualitative information on certain aspects of the new state. Such approaches can help humans better prepare for, or avoid, undesirable state transitions. The algorithm also illustrates how a universe of possible models can be mined to recognize naturally occurring tipping points.","tags":["deep learning","bifurcation","tipping point","time series"],"title":"Deep learning for early warning signals of tipping points","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Thomas M Bury","Claudia Lerma","Gil Bub","Zachary Laksman","Marc W Deyell","Leon Glass"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1601510400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653321816,"objectID":"df53b359be0c970613bbfa221d9d07e2","permalink":"https://thomasbury.net/publications/bury_chaos_20/","publishdate":"2022-05-23T16:03:36.593382Z","relpermalink":"/publications/bury_chaos_20/","section":"publications","summary":"We have analyzed the electrocardiographic data collected during continuous 7-day ambulatory recordings in patients with frequent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs).

Such events are commonly referred to as critical transitions. Current research seeks to develop early warning signals (EWS) of critical transitions that could help prevent undesirable events such as ecosystem collapse. However, conventional EWS do not indicate the type of transition, since they are based on the generic phenomena of critical slowing down. For instance, they may fail to distinguish the onset of oscillations (e.g. Hopf bifurcation) from a transition to a distant attractor (e.g. Fold bifurcation). Moreover, conventional EWS are less reliable in systems with density-dependent noise. Other EWS based on the power spectrum (spectral EWS) have been proposed, but they rely upon spectral reddening, which does not occur prior to critical transitions with an oscillatory component. Here, we use Ornstein–Uhlenbeck theory to derive analytic approximations for EWS prior to each type of local bifurcation, thereby creating new spectral EWS that provide greater sensitivity to transition proximity; higher robustness to density-dependent noise and bifurcation type; and clues to the type of approaching transition. We demonstrate the advantage of applying these spectral EWS in concert with conventional EWS using a population model, and show that they provide a characteristic signal prior to two different Hopf bifurcations in data from a predator–prey chemostat experiment. The ability to better infer and differentiate the nature of upcoming transitions in complex systems will help humanity manage critical transitions in the Anthropocene Era.","tags":[],"title":"Detecting and distinguishing tipping points using spectral early warning signals","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Thomas M Bury","Chris T Bauch","Madhur Anand"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653321817,"objectID":"80958d78be1a86b286fa3ea36773cc0b","permalink":"https://thomasbury.net/publications/bury_plos_19/","publishdate":"2022-05-23T16:03:37.066679Z","relpermalink":"/publications/bury_plos_19/","section":"publications","summary":"Geophysical models of climate change are becoming increasingly sophisticated, yet less effort is devoted to modelling the human systems causing climate change and how the two systems are coupled. Here, we develop a simple socio-climate model by coupling an Earth system model to a social dynamics model. We treat social processes endogenously—emerging from rules governing how individuals learn socially and how social norms develop—as well as being influenced by climate change and mitigation costs. Our goal is to gain qualitative insights into scenarios of potential socio-climate dynamics and to illustrate how such models can generate new research questions. We find that the social learning rate is strongly influential, to the point that variation of its value within empirically plausible ranges changes the peak global temperature anomaly by more than 1°C. Conversely, social norms reinforce majority behaviour and therefore may not provide help when we most need it because they suppress the early spread of mitigative behaviour. Finally, exploring the model’s parameter space for mitigation cost and social learning suggests optimal intervention pathways for climate change mitigation. We find that prioritising an increase in social learning as a first step, followed by a reduction in mitigation costs provides the most efficient route to a reduced peak temperature anomaly. We conclude that socio-climate models should be included in the ensemble of models used to project climate change.","tags":[],"title":"Charting pathways to climate change mitigation in a coupled socio-climate model","type":"publications"},{"authors":["A Demetri Pananos","Thomas M Bury","Clara Wang","Justin Schonfeld","Sharada P Mohanty","Brendan Nyhan","Marcel Salathé","Chris T Bauch"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653321817,"objectID":"53ba9d69e564a33f4c60902fdecf5063","permalink":"https://thomasbury.net/publications/pananos_pnas_17/","publishdate":"2022-05-23T16:03:36.916915Z","relpermalink":"/publications/pananos_pnas_17/","section":"publications","summary":"Complex adaptive systems exhibit characteristic dynamics near tipping points such as critical slowing down (declining resilience to perturbations).
