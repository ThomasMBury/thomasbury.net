# Project trained a reinforcement learning agent in Tensorflow to generate an arrhythmia with minimal stimulus.
#        - Partnered with cardiologists (UBC, Cornell) and industry (Icentia inc.) to research mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmia from wearable device data.
#        - Pre-processed ~60GB of electrocardiogram data from 12k patients using cloud resources (Compute Canada).
#        - Created and deployed data dashboards (Plotly, Dash) to visualise records and derived metrics.
#        - Implemented unsupervised machine learning (k-means) and dimension reduction techniques (PCA+t-SNE) to investigate arrhythmia subtypes.
