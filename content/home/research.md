<h2> Early warning signals for bifurcations </h2>
<br>
{{< figure src="uploads/images/fig_critical_transition.png" width="80%" >}}

A bifurcation marks a sudden qualitivate change in a dynamical system as a parameter crosses a threshold--also referred to as a tipping point or a critical transition. They correspond to phenomena such as the onset of an epidemic, a cardiac arrhythmia, and the collapse of an ecosystem. When a system is near to a bifurcation, there are universal properties of bifurcations that can emerge when sufficient data is collected. One example is critical slowing down (shown above), where the recovery rate decreases close to the bifurcation. I am interested in the developement of computational tools based on the theory of dynamical systems and machine learning to help predict the onset of a bifurcation in various natural systems.

<!-- <b>Research questions:</b>
- Can we develop early warning signals that distinguish subcritical (abrupt) from supercritical (smooth) bifurcations?
- To what extent can deep learning methods generalize to bifurcations in spatial systems?
- What features of time series are deep learning methods using to provide early warning signals?
- How do early warning signals behave in the vicinity of multiple bifurcations? -->

<h2> Nonlinear dynamics of cardiac arrhythmia </h2>
<br>

{{< figure src="uploads/images/fig_ecg_physionet.png" width="80%" >}}

The human heart beats around 100,000 times a day. A healthy heartbeat is the result of electrical propagation that travels through the heart, resulting in contraction of the cardiac tissue and pumping of blood to the body. A cardiac arrhythmia occurs when this propagation is disrupted in some way. Wearable device technology has reached the point where we can monitor the electrical activity of our hearts for extended periods of time, amassing a wealth of data. I am interested in using mathematical models and machine learning to better understand and predict the dynamics of the hearts in patients who have cardiac arrhythmia. This work is in collaboration with cardiologists at the University of British Columbia and Weill Cornell Medicine and experimental physiologists at McGill University.

Mathematical models can built for a biological system based on mechanistic principles. The dynamics of the model can then be analysed to gain insights into the original system. I have extended models in epidemiology and Earth System science to incorporate human behaviour, in order to study the coupled dynamics of human behaviour with vaccine scares and climate change, respectively.
