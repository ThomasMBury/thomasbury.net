I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/physiology" target="_blank">Department of Physiology</a> at <a href=" https://www.mcgill.ca/" target="_blank">McGill University</a>.
I'm an applied mathematician with interest in using mathematics and data analysis to study diverse topics in the natural sciences.
Much of my research involves interdisciplinary collaboration with medical doctors, physiologists and ecologists.
I am particulalry interested in tipping points and the development of computational tools to help us predict and understand them (my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfm7OqBVA6I&ab_channel=TEDxTalks" target="_blank">TEDx talk</a> gives an overview).
Please see my research and publication sections for more information.

I received my PhD in applied mathematics at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank">University of Waterloo</a> where I worked with <a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~cbauch/" target="_blank">Chris Bauch</a> and <a href="https://anand-lab-globalecochange.uoguelph.ca/" target="_blank">Madhur Anand</a>.

<!-- He currently works in the Faculty of Medicine at McGill University where the goal is to better predict a tipping point in the human heart---a cardiac arrhythmia. This work is in collaboration with cardiologists and experimental scientists. Besides <a href="https://www.thomasbury.net/#publications">research</a>, he is a technical author for the Medium publication <a href="https://medium.com/@thomasbury" target="_blank">Towards Data Science</a> and teaches a range of graduate and undergraduate <a href="/teaching">courses</a>. -->
