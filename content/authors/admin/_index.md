I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/physiology" target="_blank">Department of Physiology</a> at <a href=" https://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a>.
Thomas Bury is an applied mathematician working on tools to better understand tipping points in complex systems (see his <a href="https://www.thomasbury.net/#talks">TEDx talk</a> for an overview). He currently works in the Faculty of Medicine at McGill University where the goal is to better predict a tipping point in the human heart---a cardiac arrhythmia. This work is in collaboration with cardiologists and experimental scientists. Besides <a href="https://www.thomasbury.net/#publications">research</a>, he is a technical author for the Medium publication <a href="https://medium.com/@thomasbury" target="_blank">Towards Data Science</a> and teaches a range of graduate and undergraduate <a href="/teaching">courses</a>.
